    The Time Zone Database (often called tz or zoneinfo) contains
    code and data that represent the history of local time for many
    representative locations around the globe. It is updated periodically
    to reflect changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries,
    UTC offsets, and daylight-saving rules.
